1. Difference betwen mutability and immutability?

mutability: Mutable object can be changed or altered after they are created

Example: Lists are mutable 

immutability: Immutable objects cannot be altered after they are created

Example: Strings and tuples are Immutable



2. Difference between shallow copy and deep copy

Shallow copy: When shallow copy is used, it creates a new object, but it does not create copies of the objects contained within the original object. 
              Instead, it just copies references to the original objects.

Deep copy:  When deep copy is used, it creates a new object and recursively copies all the objects inside the original object. 
            This means that both the outer object and all the inner objects are copied.



3. what is an iterator?

An iterator is an object in Python that allows you to traverse through a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string.
